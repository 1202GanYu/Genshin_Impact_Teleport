# About Test
>**[v3.4]:Using the old optimization scheme Only the no-drop monsters have been optimized**
>
>**[v3.4-Test]:Uses the new generation logic to exclude most of the monsters that don't refresh, but there are still a few left over, such as some treasure chest guards that keep refreshing when you don't open them**
>>**This logic generation scheme is not fully tested**


# About Oculus
>**All Oculus do not remove points, so you do not need to turn on Auto Range to suck up Oculus**

>**Everything new points added after 3.4 will not be guaranteed to be complete, including 3.4 new god pupils, 3.4 new materials, monsters, etc. Reason: Mihoyo has updated the points and there is a discrepancy in the data we have with this.**
